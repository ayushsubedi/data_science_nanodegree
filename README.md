## Projects Description

### Project 1 Finding Donors for CharityML

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. The goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### Project 2 Image Classifier

In this first part of the project,  work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch. After, you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an application that others can use. Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the first part.

### Project 3 Identifying Customer Segments

In this project, our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Youâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
